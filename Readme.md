🌸 Iris Dataset Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the Iris dataset using Python.
It demonstrates:

Loading and exploring a dataset with Pandas

Performing basic statistical analysis

Creating visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Handling errors gracefully with try/except

Saving results to a report file and graphs as .png images

🛠️ Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📂 Files in this Project

script.py → Main Python script for the assignment

report.txt → Automatically generated report (summary, analysis, observations)

line_chart_petal_length.png → Line chart of petal length

bar_chart_avg_petal_length.png → Bar chart of average petal length per species

histogram_sepal_width.png → Histogram of sepal width distribution

scatterplot_sepal_vs_petal.png → Scatter plot of sepal vs. petal length

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/python-assignment-iris.git
cd python-assignment-iris


Run the script:

python script.py


Outputs:

Plots will pop up on screen

Plots will also be saved as .png images in the project folder

A detailed report.txt file will be generated with analysis and observations

📊 Observations

The line chart shows variation in petal length across samples, with clear differences between species.

The bar chart reveals that Iris-virginica has the longest average petal length, while Iris-setosa has the shortest.

The histogram shows that sepal width is most common between 2.5 cm and 3.5 cm.

The scatter plot highlights clear separation between species when comparing sepal length vs. petal length.

✨ Key Features

Clear and labeled visualizations

Automatic saving of results (report + plots)

Error handling for data loading issues
